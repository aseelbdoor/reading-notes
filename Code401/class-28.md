- How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?
```python
Django Forms facilitate user input handling by providing a way to define and validate user input in a web application. The key components of creating a form using the Django framework include:

Model: A model is a Python class that represents a database table. In Django, models are used to define the structure of the database tables that will be used to store the form data.

Form: A form is a Python class that represents a web form. In Django, forms are used to define the structure and validation rules for user input.

View: A view is a Python function that handles the HTTP request and response cycle for a web application. In Django, views are used to process the form data submitted by the user and interact with the database.

Template: A template is a HTML file that defines the structure and layout of the web page. In Django, templates are used to render the form and display the user input data.

URL: A URL is a string that maps to a view function in a Django web application. In Django, URLs are used to define the endpoints for the web application and allow users to access the form.
```

- Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.
```python
Django Templates in web development provide a way to dynamically generate HTML pages based on data from a web application. The purpose of Django Templates is to separate the presentation logic from the business logic of the web application, making it easier to maintain and update the code.

Template inheritance is a feature of Django Templates that allows developers to create a base template that defines the overall structure and layout of a web page, and then extend that template to create specific templates for different pages or sections of the website. This approach can help to improve code reusability and maintainability by reducing duplication of code and allowing developers to make changes to the base template without affecting the specific templates that inherit from it.

Template inheritance works by allowing developers to define a base template that includes a series of blocks that can be overridden by child templates. For example, a base template might include a block for the header, a block for the footer, and a block for the main content area. Child templates can then extend the base template and override the blocks as needed, adding their own unique content to the page.

By using template inheritance, developers can create a set of templates that share common elements, such as the header and footer, and then customize those templates for specific pages or sections of the website. This can help to reduce code duplication and improve the maintainability of the web application by making it easier to make changes to the overall structure and layout of the website.

- Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.
```python
Django Views in handling HTTP requests are responsible for processing the incoming requests, extracting data from the request, and returning a response to the client. The function of Django Views is to transform the incoming request into a response that can be sent back to the client.

There are two types of Django Views: function-based views and class-based views. The main difference between the two is the way they handle HTTP requests and responses.

Function-based views are defined as Python functions that take a request object as input and return a response object as output. Function-based views are simpler to create and use, but they do not provide the same level of flexibility and customization as class-based views.

Class-based views, on the other hand, are defined as Python classes that inherit from a base class and provide a set of methods that handle HTTP requests and responses. Class-based views provide more flexibility and customization than function-based views, as they can define custom methods for handling different types of requests and responses.

One of the main differences between function-based views and class-based views is the way they handle HTTP methods. Function-based views handle HTTP methods by accepting a request object as input and returning a response object as output. Class-based views handle HTTP methods by defining custom methods for each HTTP method (e.g. get(), post(), put(), delete()).

Another difference between function-based views and class-based views is the way they handle URL routing. Function-based views are mapped to specific URLs using the urlpatterns list in the urls.py file. Class-based views are mapped to specific URLs using the as_view() method of the class.
