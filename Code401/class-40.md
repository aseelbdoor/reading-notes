- What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?
  ```
  React Context is a feature that allows you to share state and data between components without having to pass props down through every level of the component tree. It's particularly useful for managing global state or data that needs to be accessed by multiple components across your application.

  With React Context, you can create a "context" object that holds the data you want to share. This context object can then be accessed by any component within its scope, regardless of how deep in the component tree they are. This eliminates the need to pass data through intermediate components just to reach a distant child component.

  React Context consists of three main parts:

  Context Provider: This component wraps around the part of the component tree where you want to make the shared data available. It provides the context value to its child components.

  Context Consumer: This component allows individual components to subscribe to the context value and access it within their render function. Context consumers automatically update whenever the context value changes.

  useContext Hook: In addition to using the Context Consumer, you can also use the useContext hook to access the context value within functional components. This hook simplifies the process of consuming context values.

  React Context is beneficial for managing state and data sharing because it promotes a more organized and efficient way to pass data between components. It reduces prop drilling (the process of passing data down through multiple levels of components), making your codebase cleaner and more maintainable. It's especially useful for situations where multiple components need access to the same data or where you want to implement a global state management solution without using third-party libraries like Redux.

- Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.
  ```
  The useContext hook is a feature in React that allows functional components to access the data from a React Context without needing to use the Context Consumer component explicitly. It simplifies the process of consuming context values and makes the code cleaner and more concise.

  Here's how you can use the useContext hook to access data from a React Context within a functional component:

  Create the Context:
  First, you need to create a context using the React.createContext() function. This will give you a context object that contains a Provider component and a Consumer component. You'll use the Provider to wrap the part of the component tree where the context data should be accessible.

  Provide the Context Value:
  Wrap your component hierarchy with the Provider component, passing the context value as a prop. The context value is the data you want to share across components.

  Access the Context Value:
  Within a functional component that needs access to the context data, you can use the useContext hook. Import the useContext function from React and then call it, passing in the context object. The hook will return the current context value.
  ```

- Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.
  ```
  
  Next.js is a popular React framework that is used to build modern, server-rendered React applications. It aims to simplify the process of creating fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications by providing built-in features for server-side rendering, routing, code splitting, and more. Next.js also offers a great developer experience with features like automatic code splitting, hot module replacement, and easy deployment options.

  Let's look at an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples repository to illustrate how Next.js can be used to build a scalable web application:

  Example: Blog with Pagination

  The "Blog with Pagination" example demonstrates how to build a blog application with server-side rendering and pagination using Next.js.

  Setup and Installation:
  To get started, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. Create a new Next.js project using the following commands:

  npx create-next-app my-blog
  cd my-blog

  Create Pages:
  In the pages directory, create a file named index.js to define the main page of the blog. In this example, we'll create a list of blog posts with pagination.

  // pages/index.js
  import Link from 'next/link';

  const Blog = ({ posts }) => (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>
            <Link href={`/posts/${post.id}`}>{post.title}</Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );

  export default Blog;

  Fetch Data:
  Next.js allows you to fetch data for server-side rendering using getServerSideProps or getStaticProps. In this example, we'll use getStaticProps to fetch a list of blog posts.

  // pages/index.js
  import Link from 'next/link';

  const Blog = ({ posts }) => (
    // ... same code as before
  );

  export async function getStaticProps() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
    const posts = await response.json();

    return {
      props: {
        posts,
      },
    };
  }

  export default Blog;

  Add Pagination:
  To implement pagination, you can modify the Blog component to display a limited number of posts per page and provide navigation links to navigate between pages.

  // pages/index.js
  import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

  const Blog = ({ posts }) => {
    const router = useRouter();
    const page = parseInt(router.query.page) || 1;
    const postsPerPage = 5;
    const startIndex = (page - 1) * postsPerPage;
    const visiblePosts = posts.slice(startIndex, startIndex +   postsPerPage);

    return (
      // ... same code as before
    );
  };

  // ... same getStaticProps code

  export default Blog;
  ```
