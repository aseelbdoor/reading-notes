# Class 01

1- In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.
```
I think that the two biggest challenges that a person faces at this level are, first, the psychological pain, such as intellectual exhaustion and fear of the consequences. Second, the physical pain due to the loss of sleep, physical rest, and long sitting in the same place.
- For mental anguish, I suggest sticking clippings of paper with positive statements and your goals that you are striving to achieve above the bed and on the desk so that you always see your goals and remember that the result is worth it.
- As for the physical pain, I suggest that you keep switching positions from the office chair to sitting on the bed or even the sofa, depending on the level of work, or even trying to go out somewhere and work with it to break the routine and the level of sitting.
```

2- After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.
```
- Time Complexity: the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. 
- Space Complexity: the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. 
```

3- Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.
```
Immutable data types have a fixed value once they are created. Any operation that seems to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object with the modified value.

Mutable data types can have their values changed after creation. Operations on mutable data types can modify the original object without creating a new one.
```
