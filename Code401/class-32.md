What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?
```
Key Components:

a. BasePermission: BasePermission is an abstract class provided by DRF. All custom permissions should inherit from this class. It contains the has_permission(self, request, view) method, which determines whether a user has permission to access a particular API view.

b. Built-in Permissions: DRF offers several built-in permissions that can be used out of the box to secure API endpoints. These include:

IsAuthenticated: Allows access to authenticated users (those who have logged in).
IsAdminUser: Allows access to admin users.
IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly: Allows read-only access to unauthenticated users while requiring authentication for write operations.
AllowAny: Allows unrestricted access to all users, including unauthenticated users.
c. Custom Permissions: In addition to the built-in permissions, DRF allows developers to create custom permissions by defining their own permission classes that inherit from BasePermission. This allows fine-grained control over access based on project-specific requirements.

Purpose of DRF Permissions:

a. Access Control: The primary purpose of DRF permissions is to control access to API endpoints. By applying permissions to different views, developers can define who can perform specific actions, such as viewing, creating, updating, or deleting resources.

b. User Authentication: Permissions like IsAuthenticated ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive or restricted parts of the API. This helps protect sensitive user data and maintain data privacy.

c. Authorization: Permissions also play a role in authorization, determining whether a user has the necessary privileges to perform certain operations. For example, the IsAdminUser permission restricts access to admin users, ensuring that only privileged users can perform administrative tasks.

d. Security: By properly configuring permissions, API developers can enhance the security of their applications and protect against unauthorized access and potential attacks.

e. Customization: The ability to create custom permissions allows developers to implement project-specific access control logic, making it possible to define complex permission rules based on various factors, such as user roles, ownership, or group membership.

Securing an API with DRF Permissions:

To secure an API using DRF permissions, developers need to follow these steps:

a. Define Permissions: Determine the appropriate permissions for each API view in your project. Choose from the built-in permissions or create custom permission classes based on your specific requirements.

b. Apply Permissions: In DRF, permissions are applied at the view level. Assign the appropriate permission classes to each view by setting the permission_classes attribute.

c. Handle Unauthorized Access: When a user does not have the required permissions to access a view, DRF will raise an exceptions.PermissionDenied or exceptions.NotAuthenticated exception. Handle these exceptions appropriately to provide meaningful error messages or responses to the users.

In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?
```
In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, as well as any filtering, grouping, sorting, or joining conditions.

The purpose of the SELECT statement is to query the database and fetch specific data that matches the specified criteria. It is a fundamental and powerful statement used in SQL for data retrieval and manipulation.

Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?
```
Django Rest Framework (DRF) Generic Views are a set of pre-built views that simplify the process of building RESTful APIs by providing common functionalities out of the box. They abstract away much of the boilerplate code typically required for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and help developers create APIs quickly and efficiently. DRF Generic Views are based on Django's generic class-based views and are specifically tailored for handling API endpoints.

The key role of DRF Generic Views is to handle common API operations, such as listing objects, creating new objects, retrieving single objects, updating objects, and deleting objects. They also integrate well with DRF serializers and model views to provide a seamless API development experience.
