- What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?
  ```
  React Context is a feature in React that provides a way to share state and data across components without the need to pass props through every level of the component tree. It's designed to solve the problem of "prop drilling," where data needs to be passed through multiple layers of components that don't directly use that data.

  React Context consists of two main components:

  Provider: This component is used to wrap a section of your component tree. It accepts a value prop that can be any data you want to share with the components within that tree. The data placed in the Provider is then accessible to all components nested within it.

  Consumer: This component allows components to consume the data provided by the Provider. It avoids the need to pass data through intermediary components that don't need the data but are only there to pass it down.

  Here's how React Context helps in managing state and data sharing:

  Avoids Prop Drilling: With Context, you can avoid passing props through every intermediate component that doesn't actually use the data. This makes your code cleaner and reduces complexity.

  Simplifies State Management: Context can be used to manage global state without needing a state management library like Redux. It's especially useful for small to medium-sized applications where a full state management library might be overkill.

  Centralized Data: Context allows you to create a centralized store of data that can be accessed by any component in the tree. This is especially useful for data that is used by multiple parts of your application.

  Component Composition: Context works well with the component composition pattern. It allows you to create smaller, reusable components that can access shared data directly.

  Performance Optimization: React Context uses a mechanism called "context re-rendering," where only the components that depend on the context data will re-render when that data changes. This can help optimize performance compared to simply using props.

- Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.
  ```
  The useContext hook is a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows functional components to access data from a React Context without the need for a Consumer component. It simplifies the process of consuming context data within functional components.

  Here's how you can use the useContext hook to access data from a React Context within a functional component:

  Creating a Context:
  First, you need to create a context using the React.createContext() function. This creates a context object that includes a Provider component and a Consumer component. However, when using the useContext hook, you don't need to directly use the Consumer component.

  import React, { useContext } from 'react';

  function MyComponent() {
      // Accessing data using useContext
      const contextData = useContext(MyContext);

      // Now you can use contextData in your component
      return (
      <div>
          {contextData}
      </div>
      );
  }

  ```

- Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.
  ```
  Next.js is a popular React framework that is used to build server-rendered React applications, as well as static websites. It enhances the development experience by providing various features that simplify building complex, scalable, and high-performance web applications. Some of its key features include server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, static site generation, and built-in routing.

  The purpose of Next.js is to offer a streamlined and opinionated way to build modern web applications that deliver fast initial loading times, excellent SEO performance, and a smooth user experience. It abstracts away many of the complexities of setting up server-side rendering, client-side routing, and other performance optimizations, allowing developers to focus on building features and functionality.
