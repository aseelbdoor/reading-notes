- What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?
```python
Serverless computing, also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), is a cloud computing model where developers focus on writing and deploying code without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. In serverless computing, the cloud provider takes care of provisioning, scaling, and managing the servers, allowing developers to focus on writing the application logic.

Key characteristics of serverless computing include:

1- No server management: With serverless computing, developers are relieved of the responsibility of managing servers. They do not have to worry about infrastructure provisioning, scaling, or maintenance. The cloud provider handles these tasks transparently.

2- Event-driven architecture: Serverless applications are event-driven, meaning they respond to specific triggers or events, such as HTTP requests, database updates, or scheduled events. When an event occurs, the associated function or code is executed.

3- Automatic scaling: Serverless platforms automatically scale the application based on the incoming workload. The infrastructure scales up or down dynamically to accommodate the current demand, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

4- Pay-per-use pricing model: Serverless computing follows a pay-per-use pricing model. You are billed only for the actual execution time and resources consumed by your code. This model offers cost efficiency as you do not pay for idle resources.

5- Stateless execution: Serverless functions are stateless, meaning they do not maintain any persistent state between invocations. Any required data or state must be stored externally, such as in a database or object storage service.

Differences from traditional server-based architectures:

1- Infrastructure management: In traditional server-based architectures, developers are responsible for managing the infrastructure, including provisioning, scaling, and maintaining servers. With serverless computing, this responsibility is shifted to the cloud provider.

2- Scalability: Server-based architectures typically require manual or pre-defined scaling configurations. In contrast, serverless computing automatically scales up or down based on the workload, providing seamless scalability.

3- Cost model: Traditional architectures often involve upfront costs for infrastructure provisioning and maintenance. Serverless computing follows a pay-per-use model, where you are billed only for the actual execution time, leading to potential cost savings for applications with varying workloads.

4- Development focus: Serverless computing allows developers to focus more on writing application logic and business logic rather than managing infrastructure. It promotes rapid development and deployment cycles.

5- Event-driven nature: Serverless architectures are inherently event-driven, allowing developers to build applications that respond to specific triggers or events. This event-driven model facilitates building scalable and loosely coupled systems.

- How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?
```python
To get started with Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, you can follow these steps:

1- Sign up for a Vercel account: Visit the Vercel website (vercel.com) and sign up for an account using your preferred authentication method (GitHub, GitLab, or email).

2- Install the Vercel CLI: The Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface) allows you to interact with the Vercel platform from your local development environment. Install the CLI by following the instructions provided in the Vercel documentation.

3- Set up your project directory: In your project directory, make sure you have a configuration file like "vercel.json" or "now.json" that specifies the settings for your deployment. You can customize various aspects such as routes, environment variables, and more.

4- Write your serverless function: Create a serverless function file in your project directory. Serverless functions in Vercel are written as separate files with specific naming conventions. For example, a file named "api/myfunction.js" would define a serverless function accessible at the "/api/myfunction" endpoint.

5- Test your serverless function locally: Use the Vercel CLI to run and test your serverless function locally. This allows you to verify its functionality before deploying it to the Vercel platform.

6- Deploy your serverless function: Use the Vercel CLI to deploy your serverless function to the Vercel platform. The CLI will handle the deployment process and provide you with a unique URL where your function will be accessible.

7- Configure deployment settings (optional): You can customize various deployment settings in your Vercel project, such as environment variables, domain settings, routing configurations, and more. These settings can be managed through the Vercel web dashboard or by modifying the configuration file in your project directory.

8- Monitor and manage your serverless function: Once deployed, you can monitor the performance and usage of your serverless function through the Vercel web dashboard. You can also make updates to your function, redeploy it, and manage other aspects of your project.

- What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
```python
APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs provide a way for developers to access and use the functionalities of external services, libraries, or platforms in their own applications.

In Python, APIs can be utilized to access and manipulate data from external sources in a structured and programmatic way. Here are the general steps involved in using APIs in Python applications:

1- Find and understand the API: Identify the API that provides the data or services you need. Read its documentation to understand how it works, what endpoints are available, what parameters to provide, and what data formats are returned.

2- Install necessary libraries: Install any required Python libraries or modules that facilitate API communication and data handling. Commonly used libraries for working with APIs in Python include requests, httplib, urllib, and http.client.

3- Make API requests: Use the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to send requests to the API is endpoints. Include any required parameters or authentication tokens in the request headers or body.

4- Handle API responses: Receive the responses from the API, which usually come in formats like JSON, XML, or plain text. Parse and extract the relevant data from the response using Python is built-in libraries or third-party packages such as json, xml.etree.ElementTree, or beautifulsoup4.

5- Manipulate and process the data: Once you have retrieved the data from the API, you can manipulate it using Python is data processing and analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, or csv.

6- Integrate the data into your application: Use the retrieved data to perform any required tasks in your Python application. This can include displaying the data in a user interface, analyzing it, storing it in a database, or further processing it.
```

- What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?
```python
The Requests library is a popular Python library used for making HTTP requests. It provides a simple and intuitive API for sending HTTP requests, handling response data, and working with cookies, sessions, and headers. With the Requests library, you can interact with APIs by sending various types of HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

To use the Requests library, you first need to install it using a package manager like pip. You can install it by running the following command:

pip install requests

import requests

# Send a GET request to an API endpoint
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

# Check the response status code
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Successful request
    data = response.json()  # Parse the response data as JSON
    print(data)
else:
    # Error occurred
    print('Error:', response.status_code)

```
